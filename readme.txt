Project Description
The project involves creating a linux device driver on the Raspberry Pi 3B+ to:
Output the number of times (0-9) that the infrared sensor was triggered to a 7 segment cathode led display.
When a user program reads from the device, the device should return a char (‘0’ - ‘9’) representing the number of times that the infrared sensor was triggered

This project uses the C programming language.
